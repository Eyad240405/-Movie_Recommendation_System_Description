# Movie Recommendation System Collaborative Filtering & Matrix Factorization (SVD)

## Introduction
Developed a personalized movie recommender using the MovieLens 100K dataset. The system predicts user ratings and suggests top-rated unseen movies by modeling user-item interactions and uncovering latent preferences. Combined statistical modeling with user-centric design to enhance recommendation accuracy.

## Key Features
- Item-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity
- Matrix factorization (SVD) to extract latent features and reconstruct missing ratings
- Genre-based filtering and rating aggregation to refine recommendations
- Performance evaluation using Precision@K to compare filtering vs. factorization
- Focused on personalization and relevance in movie suggestions

## Tools & Techniques
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn
Cosine Similarity, SVD, Precision@K, Data Preprocessing

## Outcome
Delivered a scalable recommendation pipeline capable of adapting to user behavior and preferences. Demonstrated the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in recommender systems, with potential applications in streaming platforms and personalized content delivery.
